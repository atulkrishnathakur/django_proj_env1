# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
# +(Addition) operator example
x = 10
y = 20
z = x+y
print(z)


# -(Subtraction) operator example
x = 10
y = 20
z = x-y
print(z)

# *(Multiplication) operator example
x = 10
y = 20
z = x*y
print(z)

# /(Division) operator example
x = 10
y = 20
z = x/y
print(z)

# %(Modulus) operator example
x = 25
y = 7
z = x % y
print(z)

# **(Exponentiation) operator example
# print(z) same as 2*2*2*2*2
x = 2
y = 5
z = x**y
print(z)

# //(Floor division	) operator example
# the floor division operator(//) rounds the result down to the nearest whole number
x = 15
y = 7
z = x // y
print(z)
