# for loop syntax with range()
"""
for index in range(n):
    statement
"""

# In this syntax, the index is called a loop counter. And n is the number of times that the loop will execute the statement.
# The name of the loop counter doesn’t have to be index, you can use whatever name you want.
# The range() is a built-in function in Python. It’s like the print() function in the sense that it’s always available in the program.
# The range(n) generates a sequence of n integers starting at zero. It increases the value by one until it reaches n.
# So the range(n) generates a sequence of numbers: 0,1, 2, …n-1. Note that it’s always short of the final number (n).
