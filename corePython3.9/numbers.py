# When a number is large, itâ€™ll become difficult to read. For example

count = 10000000000
print(count)

# To make the long numbers more readable, you can group digits using underscores, like this:
# When storing these values, Python just ignores the underscores. It does so when displaying the numbers with underscores on screen:
count = 10_000_000_000
print(count)
